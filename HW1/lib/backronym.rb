#
# Backronym is a fanciful expansion of an existing acronym or word, such as “port out, starboard home” for posh.
#
# You will create a function called make_backronym . There will be a preloaded dictionary to use. The dictionary is an object where the the keys are letters A-Z and the values are a predetermined word.
#
# Use the variable name (its name is written in the code template) to reference the uppercase letters of the dictionary.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
# dictionary["P"]=="perfect"
#
# There will be a string(without spaces) passed into the function that you need to translate to a Backronym.
#
# The preloaded dictionary can only read uppercase letters, and the value you return will have to be a string.
#
# EXAMPLES:
#
# "dgm" -> "disturbing gregarious mustache"
#
# "lkj" -> "literal klingon joke"
#
